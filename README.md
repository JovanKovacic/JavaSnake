# 🐍 Java Snake

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game written in Java using AWT and Swing.

## 📌 About

This project serves as a basic example of how to build a simple 2D game from scratch in Java.  
The snake moves around the screen, eats food, grows in size, and the game ends when it hits a wall or itself.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Set up a basic **game loop** using `Timer` and `ActionListener`
- Create a **game window** using `JFrame`
- Handle **keyboard input** using `KeyListener`
- Render graphics using `Graphics` and **double buffering** on a `Canvas`
- Structure a small-scale Java game using AWT and Swing components

## ⚙️ Technologies
